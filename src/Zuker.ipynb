    "The Zuker minimization algorithm was implemented in order to distinguish the secondary (2D) sructure of an RNA molecule given its sequence. The algorithm utilizes an Energy/Structural matrix with dimensions equal to the length *len* of the RNA sequence, and populates the cells of the matrix recursively from the i = *len* and j = 1, were i: columns and j:rows of the Energy matrix, thus:\n",

    "with $V(i,j)$ an second matrix of dimensions *len* x *len* which captures the energies at each cell. For the simplified version of the Zuker algorithm, the V Energy matrix is implemented as:\n",

    "\n",
    "The s(i,j) and h(i,j) matrices are defined as specified in the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation fo the algorithm starts by initializing all matrices that will be used, that is: W, V, s, and h. All are initialized with values 0, and will be populated accordingly, starting with $$j+5>i \\Rightarrow V(i,j)=W(i,j)= \\infty, i>j,$$ for W and V."
